# Response to the Reviewer

## Task 1 Design Choices (Implementation)

```
There are errors when attempting to create a session

KeyError: 'duration'
```

This bug has been fixed.


```
Please ensure endpoints called out in the requirements are implemented
including: getConferenceSessions (rename getAllSessions)
getConferenceSessionsByType (rename getSessionsByType)
```

These endpoint apis have been properly renamed according to the specification.

## Task 1 Design Choices (Response)

```
See note. Unable to decipher your design intention with regards to speaker and
speaker ID
```

Here. This id is the users' google+ account id number. It is similar to user's
email, but it carries much less sensitive information about the user. In this
web application, we retrive this id number through the function
`getUserId(user, id_type="email")` in the provided file `utils.py`. Instead of
passing the default argument `id_type= "email"`, here we pass `id_type="oauth"`
to get the id number associated with the user's google+ account.

## Task 3: Additional Queries

```
It would not be appropriate to expose the entire Attendee Profile information
to everyone querying this endpoint. This would be highly sensitive to a great
number of people and in fact would violate a number of privacy laws in numerous
jurisdictions.

I would suggest another query focused in on Session information helping people
quickly find sessions they would be interested in.
```

The code in the query api `getAttenderByConference()` has been modified. Now
this api is only open to the conference organizer.

## Task 3: Query Problem

```
This statement is factual incorrect

Google cloud datastore only allows ONE inequality filter for each query.
```

Google cloud datastore only allows at most one property to be applied with
inequality filters.

## Task 4: Featured Speaker
```
The work within _cacheFeaturedSpeaker could be greatly simplified with query
filters versus looping thru the entire Session list.
```

I cannot figure this one out.


```
Please note, the requirement calls for both the speaker and for the name of the
sessions being given by the speaker to be placed within the memcache message.

When a new session is added to a conference, check the speaker. If there is
more than one session by this speaker at this conference, also add a new
Memcache entry that features the speaker and session names.

```

Now, the names of all sessions by the featured speaker have been included in
the cached message.


## Code Quality & Readability

```
Please ensure all stale code is removed prior to submission.

There is a near complete lack of whitespace which makes reading your code much
more difficult than it should be.

I recommend taking a few minutes to go through your codebase and clean things
up and improve the documentation. Not only will the project be a better
reflection of your coding ability - I think you'll find it easier to work on
and debug going forward as well and remove the potential for syntax errors.
```

(1) Okay. Lots white spaces are included now.
(2) Some inaccurate comments are corrected.
(3) All stale code is removed.


## Code Reviews
### README.md

#### 1
```
I do not understand your design, could you elaborate on your design decision
with regards to speaker, what is the ID of a speaker? What does a user of your
API expected to provide, where do they get this ID?
```

Here. This id is the users' google+ account id number. It is similar to user's
email, but it carries much less sensitive information about the user. In this
web application, we retrive this id number through the function `getUserId(user,
id_type="email")` in the file `utils.py`. Instead of passing the default
argument `id_type= "email"`, here we pass `id_type="oauth"` to get the id
number associated with the user's google+ account.

#### 2
```
which time queries are you referring to ? could you point out the examples you
implemented making use of endTime beyond the solution suggested in this readme.
```

In task 3, we were asked to query for sessions before 7pm (this could be end
time). 

#### 3
```
Factually incorrect statement
```

Now. That inaccurate statement is revised to the following

Google cloud datastore only allows at most one property to be applied with
inequality filters.

### main.py 
The syntax error at line(7) has been fixed.

### conference.py
```
BooleanMessage and ConflictException have been defined inside models.py and
already imported above starting at line 32.
```

The definitions of the two classes are removed from this file.

#### 2
```
Inaccurate code comment (line 181)
```

All inaccurate comment has been removed.

#### 3
```
Stale code should be removed (line 187)
```

All stale code has been removed from the file.

#### 4
```
conference date objects can be None and this will throw errors (line 204)
```

This bug has been fixed.

#### 5
```
Inaccurate code comment (line 181)
```

All inaccurate comment has been removed.

#### 6

```
this task endpoint does not exist (line 232)

```
The respective line the file `main.py` has been corrected.

#### 7
```
Inaccurate code comment (line 232)
```

All inaccurate comment has been removed.

#### 8
```
This method is not available as it follows the same indentation from the
method declared above (line 470)
```

The indentation bug has been corrected.

#### 9
```
This method can be greatly simpified with query filter. (line)
```

I cannot figure this one out.

#### 10

```
it would not be appropriate for a public api to expose attendee information
including names and emails addresses to the entire public nor to even
registered conference attendees. (line 944)
```

Now, this query is only open to the conference organizer.
