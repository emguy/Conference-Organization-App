# Conference-Organization-App

Written in Python, this is a cloud-based API server to provide functionalities
to organize conferences events with massive amount of participants.  All user
data are stored in the Google's cloud datastore (NoSQL).  I extended the
functionality of this application to support conference sessions, users's
wishlists, time issue resolution, and to allow users to return required
searches for sessions and registered conferences.  The web frontend and the
android frontend has been provided by Udacity.

This web application is deployed on Google's Cloud Platform:
